# Testing

## User stories

---

### As a user I want to create a profile so that I can access all of the features of the website
### Happy path

> **Given**: User wants to create a new Foo

> **When**: User registers or logs in

> **Then**: The application will allow him to preform actions on the Foo crud model

### Unhappy path

> **Given**: User wants to create a new Foo

> **When**: User tries to change url without logging in

> **Then**: He will be redirected to the login page

> **And**: User will be asked to login in or register

### How we will test it

---

> Happy path
- make a post request to the ``/`` which will trigger ``store`` function inside LoginRegister controller
  - the post request body will contain what would user enter in the create form
- we will check if respond has status ``302``
- we will check if the session has no errors
- we will check if the function returned redirect to the ``/dashboard``

> Unhappy path
- make a post request to the ``/`` which will trigger ``store`` function inside LoginRegister controller
    - the post request body will contain what would user enter in the create form however with some mistakes

**Not matching passwords**
    
- entered password are not matching
- check if session has error on password

**Already taken e-mail**

- create a new user
- in the body of request we will enter email of the previously created user
- check if session has error on email

**Empty required field**
- in the post request body we will pass an empty array 
- check if the session has error on email, password, name

with this approach we can test every required field at once

### As a user I want to create a new FOO so that I can have my FOOS up to date
### Happy path

> **Given**: User wants to create a new Foo

> **When**: User pressed on Create button on the index page 

> **And**: User fills in the create form without any errors 

> **Then**: User will be redirected to the index page showing the newly created foo

### Unhappy path

> **Given**: User wants to create a new Foo

> **When**: User pressed on Create button on the index page

> **And**: User fills in the create form without filling in the required field

> **And**: User will be asked to filled in the required fields

### How we will test it

---
### Feature test
> Happy path

- create a new user using factory
- set response to be acting as a newly created user 
- make a post request to the ``/foos`` which will trigger ``store`` method inside foos controller
  - request body will be what would user enter to form when creating a new foo in GUI
- we will check if the request status is _302_
- we will check if the session has no erros
- we will check if the database contains our newly created foo

> Unhappy path

- create a new user using factory
- set response to be acting as a newly created user
- make a post request to the ``/foos`` which will trigger ``stroe`` method inside foos controller
    - request body will be what would user enter to form when creating a new foo in GUI but with required filed empty and number field as string
- we will check if session has errors on bar and happiness

### Unit tests

> Foo model isHappy method 

this method should return true or false when happiness of given foo is bigger or equal to 10

**How to test it**

_For true_

- create a new foo with the happiness value of 20
- check if the method returns true

_For false_

- create a new foo with the happiness value of 2
- check if the method returns false

> Are foo model functions returning right views

**How to test it**

For _create, index, show_

- create a new user
- set response to be acting as user 
- make a get request to the appropriate route
- and check if the returned view is what you expect it to be 

>**NOTE**: during show you have to create a new foo and pass it to the get request as well

For _404/ non existent page_

- create a new user 
- set reponse to be acting as user
- make a get reqest to some wierd url
- check if the status of response if 404

## Showcase that git push will trigger tests
